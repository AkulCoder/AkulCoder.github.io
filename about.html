    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Akul Khugher — a Data Scientist driven by curiosity and creativity. I enjoy exploring how data tells stories that inspire innovation and decision-making.</p>
    <p>I am doing my Master’s in Data Science at Eastern University and specialize in predictive modeling, data visualization, and business analytics. I’m especially interested in how AI can improve healthcare, finance, and sustainability of technology and the environment.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me studying new technologies, analyzing trends, or working on side projects that make data more accessible to everyone. My hobbies include: reading, writing, presenting, doing sports like soccer, badminton, tennis, and running. I also enjoy doing meditation, yoga, and taekwondo whenever I am stressed and need a break from life. I like talking about education, technology, healthy lifestyles, new trends, daily news, and excited to enter a new age of agentic AI! </p>
    <p><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor in Computer Science at NJIT Ying Wu College of Computing, Master in Data Science at Eastern University (currently doing), Great Learning/University of Texas-Austin Online ML Skills Certificate</p>
